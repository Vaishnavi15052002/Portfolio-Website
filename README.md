# Portfolio-Website
### Steps to Build a Portfolio Website Using HTML and CSS
##### Step 1: Plan Your Portfolio
Define the purpose (e.g., showcase projects, resume, contact info).
Gather content such as bio, skills, projects, and contact details.
Sketch a rough layout (header, sections, footer).
###### Step 2: Set Up Your Project Structure
Create a project folder (e.g., portfolio-website).
Inside, create the following files:
index.html (for website structure)
styles.css (for design and styling)
images/ (a folder to store images, if needed)
